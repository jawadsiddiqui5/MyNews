					Shakib and MIraz bag five wickets bwtween them with Miraz bagging three and the former scalping two wickets in a destructive twin spell.

					Skipper Shakib Al Hasan bagged a wicket in the very first over, picking up the wicket of his Windies counterpart Kreigg Brathwaite. The Windies skipper played for the turn but the wrong one from Shakib completely bamboozled the Windies captain
					and bowled him through the gap between bat and pad.

					Mehedi Miraz then used the slider to great effect, as Kieran Powell fell in the sixth over. Sunil Ambris then played a mindless shot to Shakib to give the Tigers skipper his second wicket of the day. Miraz then immediately removed Roston Chase
					in the next over with a delivery that did not turn as much as the batsman expected.

					Bangladesh bowled out for 508 after Riyad ton

					Bangladesh 508 all out in 154 ovrs, Mahmudullah 136; Nayeem 10*, FOWs: 1-42 (Soumya 19), 2-87 (Mominul 29), 3-151 (Mithun, 29), 4-161 (Shadman Islam, 76), 5-190 (Mushfiqur , 14, 67.3 ov), 6-301 (Shakib, 80, 96.5 ov), 7-393 (Liton, 54, 118.1
					ov),
					8-416 (Miraz, 18, 123.5 ov), 9-472 (Taijul Islam, 26, 144.4 ov), (Mahmudullah, 136, 153.6 ov)
					<br><br>
					Mahmudullah Riyad hit a classy 136 as Bangladesh posted 508 on the board in their first innings of the second Test at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The 32-year old suffered nervous moments, spending 10 overs in the nineties but overcame a few
					dramatic moments to complete his third career ton.

			<h1><a name="second"> Bangladesh 7th most vulnerable </a></h1>

			<p class="date">December 06, 2018</p>

			<div class="detail-paragraph">

				<span class="lead-paragraph">
					In a new global index, Bangladesh has been ranked seventh among the countries most affected by extreme weather events in 20 years since 1998.

					The Long-Term Climate Risk Index listed Puerto Rico and Sri Lanka as the top two affected countries.
				</span>

				<p class="show_btn">Show More</p>
				<p class="detail-text">

					<br><br>
					The index is part of a report, Global Climate Risk Index 2019, which was released at the annual climate summit in Poland's Katowice city yesterday. The report was prepared analysing damages caused by the extreme weather events that took place
					from 1998 to 2017.

					<br><br>
					According to the annual climate risk index for 2017, Bangladesh stood ninth among the countries most affected last year, up from 13th the previous year. Nepal was ranked fourth and India 14th in the list.
					Last year, 407 people died in Bangladesh due to extreme weather related events -- floods, landslide, storms and cyclones. The country also suffered an economic loss of about $2826.68 million, says the report prepared by Germanwatch, a
					Berlin-based environmental organisation.

					<br><br>
					The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has already predicted in its scientific report that risks associated with extreme events will continue to increase as the global mean temperature rises.

			<!-- <h1>Bangladesh sweep series 2-0 after biggest Test win </h1>

			<p class="date">August 20th, 2018</p>

			<h2>WI 231 all-out following on (2nd inn.) in 59.2 ovrs ; FOWs 1-2 (KC Brathwaite, 0.5 ov), 2-14 (KOA Powell, 3.6 ov), 3-23 (Ambris, 10.2 ov), 4-29 (RL Chase, 12.4 ov), 5-85 (Hope, 27.4 ov), 6-96 (Dowrich, 32.2 ov), 7-143 (Bishoo, 41.4 ov), 8-166

					Bangladesh recorded their biggest-margin victory in Test cricket, defeating the West Indies by an innings and 184 runs. It was also the first innings defeat that Bangladesh had handed to a opposition in Test cricket. The platform was laid by
					the
					batsmen with Shakib Al Hasan, Shadman Islam, Liton Das and Mahmudullah Riyad amongst the runs. Riyad's ton helped Bangladesh to a first innings total of 508. Bangladesh then picked up five wickets yesterday as the bowlers bamboozled Windies in
					a
					spin web. They picked up five wickets yesterday and another 15 today as West Indies crumbled twice while batting for less than three full sessions. Mehedi Miraz was the hero with the ball for Bangladesh. Having bagged seven in the first
					innings,
					he bagged another five in the second innings to bag 12 wickets in the match.
					Mehedi Miraz bagged his third wicket of the innings and his second ten-wicket haul in career -- the second Bangladesh bowler after Shakib to achieve this feat, as Devandra Bishoo edged to Soumya Sarkar at slip. Miraz then had Hetmyer after the
					left-hander hit a stormy 92-ball 93 as Windies lost their eighth wicket.

					Youngster Nayeem took the wicket of Shane Dowrich before Hetmyer laid seize as Windies score crossed 100. Having reached his 50 in the same over that Dowrich got out, Hetmyer hit four more sixes, including three in the same over off Shakib Al
					Hasan.
