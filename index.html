						<h1><a name="first"> Spinners on a roll as Tigers bag four early wickets </a></h1>

						<p class="date">December 09, 2018</p>

						<div class="detail-paragraph">

							<span class="lead-paragraph">
								Shakib and MIraz bag five wickets bwtween them with Miraz bagging three and the former scalping two wickets in a destructive twin spell.

								Skipper Shakib Al Hasan bagged a wicket in the very first over, picking up the wicket of his Windies counterpart Kreigg Brathwaite. The Windies skipper played for the turn but the wrong one from Shakib completely bamboozled the Windies
								captain
								and bowled him through the gap between bat and pad.

								<br><br>
								Mehedi Miraz then used the slider to great effect, as Kieran Powell fell in the sixth over. Sunil Ambris then played a mindless shot to Shakib to give the Tigers skipper his second wicket of the day. Miraz then immediately removed Roston
								Chase
								in the next over with a delivery that did not turn as much as the batsman expected.

								Bangladesh bowled out for 508 after Riyad ton

								Bangladesh 508 all out in 154 ovrs, Mahmudullah 136; Nayeem 10*, FOWs: 1-42 (Soumya 19), 2-87 (Mominul 29), 3-151 (Mithun, 29), 4-161 (Shadman Islam, 76), 5-190 (Mushfiqur , 14, 67.3 ov), 6-301 (Shakib, 80, 96.5 ov), 7-393 (Liton, 54, 118.1

								8-416 (Miraz, 18, 123.5 ov), 9-472 (Taijul Islam, 26, 144.4 ov), (Mahmudullah, 136, 153.6 ov)
								<br><br>
								Mahmudullah Riyad hit a classy 136 as Bangladesh posted 508 on the board in their first innings of the second Test at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The 32-year old suffered nervous moments, spending 10 overs in the nineties but overcame a
								few
								dramatic moments to complete his third career ton.

								More and more Bangladeshi students are choosing to pursue higher education in Japan. Since studying abroad is a substantial investment and a major life decision, students need to consider several criteria in universities as they proceed to

								one of Japan's top global universities, and it fares well in all of these parameters - making it one of the top choices for any student.

								Japanese students and half (51.4%) international students. The campus is comprised of students, faculty and alumni with 89 countries and regions represented by students, 24 countries and regions represented by faculty and 144 countries and

						<h1><a name="fourth"> Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid </a></h1>

						<div class="detail-paragraph">

							<span class="lead-paragraph">

								Flat-earthers rejoice! Everyone's favourite flat-engine manufacturer, Subaru, has launched a new hybrid SUV that you can use to climb rocky protrusions in your flat-earth dreams. This boxer powered SUV has just been launched in the US, but
								the Crosstrek is slated to get an introduction in other markets as well. Under the hood is 2 litre boxer motor hooked up to a CVT, putting power to the ground via Subaru's patented Assymetrical All-Wheel Drive system.

							<p class="detail-text">

								<br><br>
								There's rumours of an official launch of Subaru vehicles in Bangladesh, a second coming for the brand after a less-than successful initial attempt in the late-2000s. The roster apparently includes the Impreza sedan, XV crossover and the
								Forester SUV. With the Crosstrek sitting in between, there's a slight chance it might come here as well.
								<br><br>

								The Crosstrek Hybrid uses Subaru StarDrive Technology to combine the efficiency of a plug-in electric vehicle for city commuting with the long-range capability of a SUBARU BOXER® gasoline engine for road trips without limits. The gas engine
								charges the electric battery, even if you can’t plug in, so there’s no worry about running out of electric power. The Crosstrek Hybrid provides up to 90 MPGe and up to 480 miles of total vehicle range,[2] all with the confidence of
								Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive.

							<span class="lead-paragraph">

								Microsoft has released the beta version of Launcher 5.1 which features a phone usage tracker.

								As smartphones are further being integrated into nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it's no wonder they've become a third arm to most of us, and it's also no wonder some users are trying to get their phone dependency in check.

								<br><br>
								The new Microsoft Launcher that the company is currently testing, as reported on by Windows Central, will appeal specifically to those who are brave enough to track their daily phone activity. This new element, which testers are referring to
								as a "Digital Health" feature, tracks how you use your phone including the number of unlocks, length of activity sessions and total time spent on the phone, most used and most opened apps, and at what time of day each of these actions
								happened. Apple introduced a Screen Time feature in iOS 12, which provides similar information to iPhone users.
								<br><br>

								Additionally, Cortana is back and can be enabled from the launcher, as well as Microsoft Notes and To Do which sync across all devices.

								You can become a tester for the Microsoft Launcher beta 5.1 here if you can't wait to see how much you use your phone. Otherwise, if testing goes well, the official version should be available soon. – AFP Relaxnews

							<span class="lead-paragraph">


China will keep its economic growth within a reasonable range next year, striving to support jobs, trade and investment while pushing reforms and curbing risks, the top decision-making body of the Communist Party, the politburo, said on Thursday.

							<p class="detail-text">

								<br><br>
								“We will promote steady growth, promote reform, adjust structure, benefit people's livelihood and prevent risks in a coordinated way, and keep economic operation in a reasonable range,” the official news agency Xinhua reported, citing a politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping.

	The government has recently launched a raft of measures, including reductions in reserve requirements for banks, tax cuts and more infrastructure spending, to ward off a sharp deceleration in the economy. Further steps to bolster growth are expected.
								<br><br>

								It will further stabilize employment, the financial sector, foreign trade, investment and market expectations and boost market confidence, Xinhua said.

The politburo called for greater awareness of potential problems in the economy given changes in both external and domestic conditions.
